## Side Protocol

Side Protocol is an infrastructure for mesh liquidity, a network of liquidity which is distributed across different networks but interconnected via arbitrary messaging protocols. At the core of the mesh liquidity network lies SIDE, a layer-1 Cosmos-SDK based blockchain housing the flagship implementation of Side Protocol.

## Interchain Tech Stacks

1. ICS 100: Interchian Atomic Swap

Interchain Atomic Swap (IAS) is a trustless and decentralized protocol for inter-blockchain asset atomic swaps, following the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol standard (ICS-100). In the context of IAS, two participants who own assets on separate blockchains agree to trade their assets without the need for a centralized exchange or undergoing a bridging process such as lock & mint.

2. ICS 101: Interchain AMM Swap

Interchain AMM Swap (IAMS) is an inter-blockchain asset swap mechanism that utilizes an Automated Market Maker protocol. This type of swap leverages liquidity pools and algorithmic pricing to facilitate bridgeless asset swaps without the reliance on traditional order books or centralized exchanges. In the context of IAMS, the state of a liquidity pool transcends individual blockchains and exists across multiple blockchains, encompassing two or more liquidity hubs. The liquidity pool on different chains serves as the source of liquidity for the swaps. Users can then directly trade their assets from the pool, with the AMM algorithm determining the exchange rate based on the available liquidity.
