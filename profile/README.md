## Side Protocol ðŸ‘‹

Side Protocol is developing a distributed inter-blockchain liquidity mesh network system that utilizes innovative IBC-based swap application protocols (ICS100-Interchain Atomic Swap and ICS101-Interchain AMM Swap). Unlike liquidity hubs, Side Protocol aims to decentralize liquidity between diverse blockchain networks in a bridgeless manner, while maintaining interconnectivity. At the core of the Side Protocol lies SIDE, a robust EVM-compatible layer-1 infrastructure that serves as the system's liquidity engine. SIDE is responsible for fostering interconnectivity and ensuring sufficient liquidity between different blockchain networks. Additionally, SIDE offers massive incentives to developers through its unique "Adopt to Earn" integrated chain module, encouraging active participation and traction boostrapping.

## Public Goods ðŸŒˆ 

1. ICS 100: Atomic Swap

Users may wish to exchange tokens without transferring tokens away from their native chain. ICS-100 enabled chains can facilitate atomic swaps between users and their tokens located on the different chains. This is useful for exchanges between specific users at specific prices, and opens opportunities for new application designs.

For example, a token exchange would require only one transaction from an user, compared to multiple transactions when using ICS-20. Additionally, users can minimize trade slippage compared to using a liquidity pool, given there is a willing counter-party.

3. ICS 101: Interchain Swap

ICS-101 Interchain Swaps enables chains to have their own token pricing mechanism and exchange protocol via IBC transactions. By enabling their own token pricing mechanism and exchange protocol, each chain can play a role in a fully decentralised exchange network.
Features include an option to provide liquidity with a single asset instead of a pair, which users might prefer as it reduces the risk of impermanent loss.
