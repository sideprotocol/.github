## Side Protocol

Side Protocol is an infrastructure designed for omnichain asset exchange. At its core lies SIDE, a blockchain based on the Cosmos-SDK and CometBFT. It is designed as a chain abstraction layer and employs a hybrid methodology that combines IBC and TSS. This enables interoperability across all chains, including non-smart contract chains such as Bitcoin.
