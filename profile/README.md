## Side Protocol

Side Protocol is an infrastructure for mesh liquidity, a network where the distribution of liquidity is decentralized across different networks but interconnected via generic cross-chain messaging protocols. At the core of the mesh liquidity network lies SIDE, a layer-1 Cosmos-SDK based blockchain housing the flagship implementation of Side Protocol.
